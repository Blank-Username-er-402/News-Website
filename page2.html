                <h2>Eating Crayons found to boost morale in the marines</h2>
                <img src="Images/Marine eating crayons.jfif" alt="">
                <p>A study tested on U.S marines showed that ingesting crayons <br>
                while in a group "brought them back to childhood" and boosted morale. <br>
            This seemingly was due to it bringing them bakc to childhood memories which <br>
        renewed their want to be in the marines. Now it is mandatory to carry a pack of 32 <br>
    crayons in every unit.</p>
